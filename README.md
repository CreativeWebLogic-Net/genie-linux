# genie-linux
Genie is a Bash script to install the most popular web server used currently online.<br>
These are the components installed:<br>
  Apache2<br>
  Sqlite3<br>
  MySQL<br>
  PHP<br>
  Adminer SQL Web Interface<br>
<br>
The script was created for these versions of Linux:<br>
  ubuntu<br>
  centos<br>
  debian<br>
  oracle<br>
  redhat<br>
  opensuse<br>
  arch<br>
  mint<br>
<br>
It also downloads and installs CWLNets Website Helper CMS / Framework Software.<br>
<br>
I haven't checked every Linux version Install but she should be right.<br>
<br>
Why did I create this? Because the number of times I have had to reinstall servers just kills me..<br> 
So I made these scripts just get the basics done and dusted..<br>
