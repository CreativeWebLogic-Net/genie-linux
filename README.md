# genie-linux
Genie is a Bash script to install the most popular web server used currently online.
These are the components installed:
  Apache2
  Sqlite3
  MySQL
  PHP
  Adminer SQL Web Interface

The script was created for these versions of Linux:
  ubuntu
  centos
  debian
  oracle
  redhat
  opensuse
  arch
  mint

It also downloads and installs CWLNets Website Helper CMS / Framework Software.

I haven't checked every Linux version Install but she should be right.

Why did I create this? Because the number of times I have had to reinstall servers just kills me.. 
So I made these scripts just get the basics done and dusted..
