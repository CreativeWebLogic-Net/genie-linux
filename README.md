It also downloads and installs CWLNets Website Helper CMS / Framework Software.<br>
<br>
I haven't checked every Linux version Install but she should be right.<br>
<br>
Why did I create this? Because the number of times I have had to reinstall servers just kills me..<br> 
So I made these scripts just get the basics done and dusted..<br>
<br>
<br>
To Install your Lamp web server just download the Zip from GitHub or just the central script file "website-helper-install.sh"..<br>
On the command line execute the script:<br>
First make the file executable.<br>
"sudo chmod +x ./website-helper-install.sh"<br>
Then run it.<br>
"sudo ./website-helper-install.sh"..<br>
Thats all you need to do.<br>
